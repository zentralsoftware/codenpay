Dear Faisal,

first of all thank you for application and your interest in our company.
 
We would like to ask you to prepare a task before we schedule the interview:
 
"Tokenization and One-click checkout tutorial with COPYandPAY”
- The online tutorials for Tokenization and One-click checkout can be found respectively: 
>> https://docs.oppwa.com/tutorials/integration-guide/widget-tokenisation
>> https://docs.oppwa.com/tutorials/integration-guide/one-click

Assignment:
Implement a basic checkout page experience based on COPYandPAY that features the tokenisation and one-click checkout solutions.
The application must execute the following steps:
Phase 1 (Store the card)
> Load COPYandPAY widget where the user can enter credit card data
>> After the payment button is clicked both the payment and the storing of the credit card details happen
> Retrieve from the response
>> Id of the payment transaction
>> Id of the tokenized card

Phase 2 (Use the token)
> The shopper comes back on the checkout page and wants to use the tokenized card in Phase 1.
>> The widget is rendered as One-clik checkout showing the card stored in Phase 1
> The shopper executes the payment
> Retrieve from the response
>> Id of the payment transaction

Validation criteria:
- The amount of the payment should be EUR 99,95.
- The card holder must be you name.
- The following test-card numbers are used:
1) 4200 0000 0000 0000
2) 4012 0010 3627 5556

- Provide us with the unique-ID of the tests peformed
- Provide us the source codes for step 1 to 3
- This source code must be working when copy-and-pasted into an application.
Finally, answer briefly the following questions:
> What is the difference between card 1 and card 2? 
> Can you describe the checkout worflow from the shopper perspective?
> Is the workflow different between card 1 and card 2? Why? How does this impact the user experience?

Just to give you a hint for your effort: I would assume this task to take not more than 1 hour. Maybe 2 hours if you use a less well-known language.

We expect your results within in a week. It is not a problem if you can’t make it, please let us know by when we can expect your response.

After receiving your response, the next process step would be a face to face interview to be done in person or remotely.

Please let us know about your availability.

I look forward to your response!

Thank you, 
Christina
